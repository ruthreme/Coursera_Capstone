Strong industries are heathcare with several hospitals located in the city, \nEducation e.g the University of Western Ontario (UWO), Insurance and Technology industries. for heathcare and education with several hospitals located. Also they hold cultural events, Tourists can also explore the settlement changes that \nhappened after the natural disasters and immigration influence over time since the early settlers example links to the UK with many similar names and systems.   \n\n  \nI want to compare Downtown Toronto neighbourhoods and London Ontario using location data from Foursquare API, using the location data to look at the different neighbourhoods in these cities to find the most popular venues in each.\n"
